			<strong><u>Arbitration</u></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			At myDoorman’s or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or the Service that are not
			resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
			arbitration will be held in San Francisco,California<strong><em> </em></strong> before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the
			parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by
			JAMS unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand
			for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the
			arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the
			limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Terms of Service and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any
			other damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Service, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator
			may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a
			proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the
			other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in
			court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable
			in any court of competent jurisdiction.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory section above, if myDoorman changes this ‘Arbitration’ section after the date you first accepted these
			Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service ), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30
			days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Date of Last Revision” date above or in the date of myDoorman’s email to you notifying
			you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and myDoorman in accordance with the
			provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Termination</u></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			You agree that myDoorman, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service, for any reason,
			including, without limitation, for lack of use or if myDoorman believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these
			Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to
			appropriate law enforcement authorities. myDoorman may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof,
			with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without

			third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without
			regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and myDoorman agree to
			submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of myDoorman
			to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these
			Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect
			to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree
			that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of
			Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any
			notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent
			and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this
			Terms of Service without the prior written consent of myDoorman, but myDoorman may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without
			restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via
			either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or
			links to notices generally on the Service.
